What is Git? 
Git is a DevOps tool used for source code management. It is a free and open-source version control system used to handle small to very large 
projects efficiently. Git is used to tracking changes in the source code, enabling multiple developers to work together on non-linear 
development

What is GitHub and why it is used?
GitHub allows you to create, store, change, merge, and collaborate on files or code. Any member of a team can access the GitHub repository (think of this as a folder for files) and see the most recent version in real-time. Then, they can make edits or changes that the other collaborators also see.
