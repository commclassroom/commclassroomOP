steps i was followed:

1.Go to any repo, at right there a option for fork.click fork
,you can add description and then click create.

2.Now you are on your Account and repo also forked.To add your
contribution your first need to clone this repo.At first click on
Code and copy the http and the git command
for clone is "git clone <-http->"

3.Now you can see the repo in your local.

4.Create a new branch (cmd:git branch Bname).And then switch
to that branch from you main brach using (cmd:git checkout Bname).

5.Please make your valuable contribution.Push it in your repo using 
cmd "git push origin Bname".
